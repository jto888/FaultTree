\title{ Add a Dormant Component Event }

\description{Modifies an existing fault tree with the addition of a dormant component event.}

\usage{
addDormant(DF, at, mttf=NULL, mttr=NULL, prob="repair", inspect=NULL, 
			name="",description="")
}

\arguments{
\item{DF}{ A fault tree dataframe such as returned from ftree.make or related add... functions.}
\item{at}{ The ID of the parent node for this addition.}
\item{mttf}{The mean time to failure.  It is the user's responsibility to maintain constant units of time.}
\item{mttr}{The mean time to repair (restore).  It is the user's responsibility to maintain constant units of time.}
\item{prob}{An underlying probability of the component being in a failed state. This will be additive to the fractional downtime due to inspection interval. A probability value >=0 && <1 can be provided. Often it is known that unavailable risk continues during repair upon inspection detection, so a string value of "repair" is accepted and the Pzero will be calculated as mttr/(mttf/mttr).}
\item{inspect}{The time interval between inspections for the dormant component. It is possible to enter the string for the named inspection dataframe object.  In this case the inspection object will be read to get the inspection interval. An inspection object must be a dataframe with interval and duration columns. If a positive duration value other than zero is found it is taken that the system is at risk during the time of inspection. An unavailable probability calculated as duration/(interval+duration) will be added to the fractional downtime.}
\item{name}{ A short identifying string }
\item{description}{ An optional string providing more detail for the resultant event.}
}

\value{
Returns the input fault tree dataframe appended with an entry row for the defined component event.
